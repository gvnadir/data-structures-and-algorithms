# What is a good code?

1. Readable
2. Scalable
    * Speed
    * Memory

# Big O

## Big O notation

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to analyze and compare the efficiency and scalability of algorithms,
with time complexity (speed) being one of the primary factors considered.

## Scalability

Scalability refers to how well a system or algorithm can handle larger and more complex tasks or data. When we talk about scalability,
we want to know how the performance of the system changes when we increase the workload or input size.
